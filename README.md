Requires:
--------------------
 * npm 3.10.10 or greater



Instuctions:
---------------------
First make sure the backend is running properly.

The backend can be fond at this repo: https://github.com/alec-horwitz/Corcoran_Full-Stack_Challenge_Backend

Then fork this repository and clone it to your computer.

Open up a terminal window, navigate to the directory this read me resides in and run the following commands:

 * npm install
 * npm start

npm will try to run on port 3000 but if you followed the instruction properly the backend should already be running on that port. As such when npm asks if you'd like to run on a different port answer "y" for yes.

If you start the frontend before the backend ruby will not be so helpful in finding another port to start on for you. This is why you must start the backend first.



Try it live:
